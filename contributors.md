# Neo4py

Neo4py is a Python library designed to provide a better alternative to py2neo for interacting with Neo4j graph databases. 

## Getting Started

To get started with developing and contributing to Neo4py, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

To install the dependencies required for developing Neo4py, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or you can use __uv__ to do so by running:
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

## Contributing

Welcoming contributions to enhance Neo4py! Here are some areas where I need help:

### 1. Load CSV Methods

I need methods to load data from CSV files into the Neo4j graph database. This includes:

- Reading CSV files using Python's built-in CSV module or Pandas.
- Creating nodes and relationships in the Neo4j database from the CSV data.
- Providing options for batch processing to handle large CSV files efficiently.

### 2. AI or Pandas AI

I am looking to integrate AI functionalities to enhance data processing and analysis capabilities. This includes:

- Implementing basic machine learning algorithms using libraries such as scikit-learn.
- Integrating Pandas AI for advanced data manipulation and analysis.
- Providing examples and documentation for using these AI features with Neo4j.

### 3. Implementing the same technology using TypeScript
- One has to implement the same technology with same features and methods using TypeScript.

### 4. Relationships
- I am not good with making relationships that goes with programming as well. So, adding a way to make relationships with the creation of nodes.
